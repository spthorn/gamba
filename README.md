This project describes a wifi-enabled device that sits in your car, powered from a 12V accessory plug. It tracks actual mileage using a GPS, and communicates automatically to the mothership website when in range of your home wifi network. Mileage data is available when logged into the mothership website.

"Gamba" is the working project name.

Review the [current Wiki docs](https://github.com/spthorn/gamba/wiki). Please contribute!

Code will start appearing here shortly.
